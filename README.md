# Jack Heller's Github Page

Hello, I'm Jack.  This is my Github page where I will be posting projects primarily from COMM 165.

I am a senior at Lehigh University studying Industrial and Systems Engineering.  My focus is primarily on machine learning.  I am passionate about energy systems and I am currently working on a publication about Argentina's energy systems and the sustainability of them.  I am very interested in data science and I am planning to contine my education in this area through a masters of statistics at KU Leuven in Belgium.

I am originally from White River Junction, Vermont and my passion is aviation.  I have completed my private pilot's license and I look forward to pursuing my instrument rating!  I learned how to fly on Diamond DA20s but I would like to work toward a tailwheel endorsement as well.
